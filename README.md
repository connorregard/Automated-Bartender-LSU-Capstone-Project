# Automated-Bartender-LSU-Capstone-Project
Automated Bartender (Senior Design Project)
This project is a fully automated drink-dispensing system designed as part of my senior engineering capstone. I worked on a multidisciplinary team with two Mechanical Engineers, one Computer Engineer, and myself as the Electrical Engineer. Together, we designed a portable bartender that mixes beverages automatically using sensors, pumps, valves, and a touchscreen interface.

Key Responsibilities

Led the electrical design, including power distribution, safety devices, and component integration

Programmed the system logic using a CompactLogix PLC and created the control flow for alcohol and mixer dispensing

Built the HMI interface for drink selection, system status, and cleaning cycles

Created wiring schematics, network topology drawings, and bill of materials

Integrated pumps, valves, and sensors to ensure accurate and repeatable dispensing

Worked closely with Mechanical teammates on the physical assembly and with the Computer Engineer on system communication

System Summary

The automated bartender can:

Dispense multiple alcohols and mixers through a controlled process

Measure and mix drinks at the press of a button

Perform an end-of-service water purge cycle to clean internal lines

Operate on a portable 24V DC power system inside an enclosed, organized control cabinet

This project brought together mechanical design, electrical engineering, automation, and teamwork into a complete working system from concept to prototype.
